# ☕ 100 Days of Java with Anushka Sharma
Hey there! 👋  
I'm Anushka, and this is my personal space to document my **100 Days of Code** journey — dedicated purely to **Java**! 💻✨

No pressure, just pure learning, failing, fixing, growing — one day at a time. 🚀

---

## 🎯 Why I'm Doing This

I want to:
- Actually *understand* Java, not just memorize it 😅
- Get strong with **OOPs, DSA**, and all the core concepts
- Build cool stuff with code!
- Stay consistent and disciplined with learning

## 📓 My Daily Log

| Day | What I Did | Notes |
|-----|------------|-------|
| Day 1 | Set up repo & revised basics | Starting slow and steady! |
| Day 2 | Practiced loops and patterns | Java makes sense now 😭💡 |
| Day 3 | Solved DSA problems | Feeling powerful! 💪 |
| ...  | ...        | ...   |
| Day 100 | Final reflections + mini project | *We made it!* 🥳🎉 |
